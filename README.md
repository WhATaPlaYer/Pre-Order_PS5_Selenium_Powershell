# Pre-Order_PS5_Selenium_Powershell
A little script that inform you when PS5 is available to buy / I have used "Wirepusher" to send webservice

YOu can use and edit this script to receive a message on your mobile phone when a specific offer is available. Simply set it up with the app "Wirepusher" to receive these webservices from your server or computer.

But at first you should download Selenium Webdriver / Chromedriver, set it up and than you will be able to use my litte script here ;)
